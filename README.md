# Hi, I'm Vishal
I'm studying computer science at the University of Florida. I like data science and software engineering.
Some fun facts about me are that I'm trilingual, and my second favorite cereal is Cheerios.

Note: if this GitHub seems like it is lacking commits, it's because most of my commits are for research and work, 
most of which cannot be published, being intellectual property and school assignments.
